# LibChat/LibAnswers Integration Widget

This code creates a question prompt that will direct users to either LibChat or LibAnswers depending on whether the LibChat instance is online or not. Currently there is no way to start a chat in LibAnswers with a prepopulated first questions *without* using the LibChat widget. I'm putting this code up so they can tinker with it and hopefully add that functionality to the API. :)
